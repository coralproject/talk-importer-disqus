## Purpose

This module can:

* parse conventional commit message of the type `type(scope): message`
* validate a given message if it fits the above simple format
* guide the user with questions in order to form well formatted message

The validation was copied from [validate-commit-msg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validate-commit-msg),
and the wizard is used from [cz-conventional-changelog](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-conventional-changelog).

## Install and use

    npm install --save conventional-commit-message

See [simple-commit-message](https://github.com/bahmutov/simple-commit-message) for API details.
